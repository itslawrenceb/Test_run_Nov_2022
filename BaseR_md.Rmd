## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Descriptive statistics
```{r}
getwd()
```

## Load to an object called
```{r}
readRDS("my_day2matrix.rds")

new <- readRDS("my_day2matrix.rds")

new
```

##  Add row sums and means
```{r}
new_1 <- cbind(new, rowSums = rowSums(new), rowMeans = rowMeans(new))

new_1
```

##  Load the ToothGrowth
```{r}
data("ToothGrowth")
```
## find more information on this dataset

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth)
col(ToothGrowth)
dim(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```
## mean of tooth length?

```{r}
mean(ToothGrowth $len)
mean(ToothGrowth [,1])
```
## maximum and minimum of the teeth length?

```{r}
max(ToothGrowth [,1])
min(ToothGrowth $len)
```
## Can you calculate rowSums and rowMeans on this data

```{r}
cbind(ToothGrowth, rowSums = rowSums(ToothGrowth), rowMeans(ToothGrowth))
## this code will not produce an output because it contains some string characters
```

## Custom function
```{r}
hypotenuse <- function (x, z) {hypo <- sqrt(x**2 + z**2)^0.5
return(hypo)}
```


```{r}
hypotenuse(5,6)
```
## Apply function on a matrix
## Sapply and lapply

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)

square <- function(y){
sq=y^2
return(sq)
}

square(5)
```
## lapply
```{r}
lapply(x, square)
```
## sapply
```{r}
sapply(x, square)
```

## Listing both numeric and logical vectors

```{r}
new_list <- list(x, vector1, seq(from = 10, to = 18, by = 2), c(T, T, F, T, F))

sapply(new_list, sum)
lapply(new_list, sum)

```
## Repeat each element using sapply

```{r}
sapply(new_list, rep, each = 3)
```
